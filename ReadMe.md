Homework assignment

Teacher's (somewhat vague) instructions: "Implement a program that will take ANY such formula for the Caesar Cipher.  You will use/need this for the first Midterm exam. Use the 3+P mod 26 initially for your assignment; make sure your program can handle ANY formula."

My interpretation: Implement a program that takes an equation, convert it from infix into reverse polish notation. What else could he have meant? (< NOT sarcastic)
